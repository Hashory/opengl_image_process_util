This library uses ModernGL to manipulate images in various formats. It accepts either ndarrays or OpenGL Texture with Contexts as input and outputs a single image, either as an ndarray or OpenGL Texture. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Write Tests**: Always write tests to verify the functionality of your code. Use `pytest` as the testing framework. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting your changes.
2. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality by following best practices and coding standards.
3. **Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly to make it easy for others to understand and maintain.
4. **Performance**: Optimize the code for performance, especially when dealing with large images or complex operations.
5. **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with the latest version of ModernGL and other dependencies.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues gracefully.
7. **Functional Programming**: Adopt a functional programming approach. Use classes only in a stateless manner. Reassigning variables within functions is acceptable.
