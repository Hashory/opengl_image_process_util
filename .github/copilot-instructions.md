This library uses ModernGL to manipulate images in the form of ndarrays. It takes one or more ndarrays as input and outputs a single ndarray. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Write Tests**: Always write tests to verify the functionality of your code. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting your changes.
2. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality by following best practices and coding standards.
3. **Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly to make it easy for others to understand and maintain.
4. **Performance**: Optimize the code for performance, especially when dealing with large images or complex operations.
5. **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with the latest version of ModernGL and other dependencies.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues gracefully.
